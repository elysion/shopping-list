# Yet another shopping list web app

Shopping list app for listing and marking items that are bought frequently.

The point of the app is to make it easy to add items to the shopping list
when they run out and make it easy to mark then bought at the store.

The backend is implemented using [LoopBack](http://loopback.io) and the
frontend using 
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

In order to run the backend and frontend servers you need to install the
dependencies running ```npm install``` in both the root and front folders.

To start the server run the following command in the root folder:
```
node .
```

To start the frontend server (in development mode), run the following 
command in the front folder:
```
npm start
```
